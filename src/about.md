# About EJPSoil Datahub

The catalogue contains metadata and includes links to, and information about the datasets. It includes mechanisms for improvement of metadata through a participatory approach through ‘Edit on Git’ (see How does it work and how to operate, and the tutorials). The catalogue is provided with searching tools as described in the following paragraphs of the present deliverable. Tutorials are supplied on how to use the catalogue, and these tutorials were included in the EJP SOIL T5.5 capacity building courses on soil data assimilation (6-8 April 2022 and 24-26 January 2023).  

The catalogue itself can be accessed at: https://catalogue.ejpsoil.eu. These pages provide some background to the catalogue content.

The catalogue provides an overview and allows better findability of relevant authoritative and research soil datasets that can be used by the Mission Soil, the Mission Soil projects, other soil research projects, single researchers and by local, regional, national and European authorities. There are no restrictions on access to the metadata and it is therefore of value to the entire EU soil community and adjacent domains. The EJP SOIL catalogue will be transferred in 2025 to the European Soil Observatory.
